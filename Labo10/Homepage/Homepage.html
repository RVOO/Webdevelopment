                Origin
            </h2>
            <p>
                The origin of Kermit's name is a subject of some debate. It is often claimed that Kermit was named after Henson's childhood friend Kermit Scott, from Leland, Mississippi.
                However, Karen Falk, head archivist and board of directors member for the Jim Henson Legacy organization, denies this claim:<br>

                <span>While Jim Henson did have a childhood acquaintance named Kermit, it was not an uncommon name at the time,
                        and Jim always said that the Frog was not named after this child from his elementary school.</span><br>

                Joy DiMenna, the only daughter of Kermit Kalman Cohen who worked as a sound engineer at WBAL-TV during Jim Henson's time with Sam and Friends,
                    recalls that the puppet was named after her father.
                According to Kermit Cohen's obituary, as well as DiMenna and Lenny Levin, a colleague of Mr. Cohen's at WBAL:<br>

                <span>The late puppeteer had been the host of a show, Sam and Friends, at WRC-TV in Washington when he was invited to tour WBAL's studios.
                    Both were NBC affiliates then, and WBAL carried the show, Mr. Levin said.

                Mr. Henson was introduced to members of the sound and camera crew, including Mr. Cohen.
                    "When he heard his name, Jim turned around, snapped his fingers and said to his wife: That's what we call the frog, Kermit."</span><br>

                Another common belief is that Kermit was named for Kermit Love, who worked with Henson in designing and constructing Muppets, particularly on Sesame Street,
                    but Love's association with Henson did not begin until well after Kermit's creation and naming, and he always denied any connection between his name and that of the character.
                    <br>
                As Sesame Street is localized for some different markets that speak languages other than English, Kermit is often renamed.
                In Portugal, he is called Cocas, o Sapo (sapo means "toad"), and in Brazil, his name is similar: Caco, o Sapo.
                In most of Hispanic America, his name is la rana Ren&eacute; (Ren&eacute; the Frog), while in Spain, he is named Gustavo.
                In the Arabic version, he is known as Kamel, which is a common Arabic male name that means "perfect". In Hungary, he is called Breki (onomatopoetic).

                    <li>
                        <span>Kermit was made out of a coat.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>He wasn't originally a frog. In his early appearances on the locally broadcast TV show 'Sam and Friends,' Kermit was a creature of indeterminate species.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>He wasn't the original star of 'The Muppet Show', the pilots were.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>He's left-handed.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>He has an honorary degree.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>He and Miss Piggy might be married.</span><br>
                        This depends on how you interpret the final scene in 'The Muppets Take Manhattan.'
                        There is a wedding between Kermit and Miss Piggy at the end of the film, but it's not clear if
                            it's between the real Kermit and Piggy or just the characters with the same names who they play in the movie.
